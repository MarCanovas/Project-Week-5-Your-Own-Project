## Project Description
We all know that Airbnb has raised some controversy regarding housing pricing and availability for the locals of the area, specially on Barcelona, where it is a heated topic to the point the city council is studying taking action on the matter. 

Due to the current situation of the COVID-19 crisis, Airbnb has released a publicity campaing incouraging people to help the owners of the website listings, suggesting they are struggling because of the lack of clients. But, is the idea they are selling accurate? Are those people really dependant on the income of the Airbnb's rents or are they in fact people who just increase their wealth by getting advantage of their "spare houses"?

## Questions & Hypotheses
### Main question
Who really are the listing owners of Airbnb?

### Main hypothesis
The majority of the owners own more than an only listing.
